In this class, I learned the basics of programming in C++.

# Assignment 1 Part 1

In this project, I created a vending machine type scenario. Each drink is has a specific number that it corresponds to. The user can order a particular drink by typing a certain number. From there, the program will check if the drink is available or not. If the drink is available, it will make sure that the user types in the appropriate cost amount to purchase the particular drink. In order to determine the types of drinks available and its costs, the data was stored in a txt file.

From there, the program will check if the drink is available or not. If the drink is available, it will make sure that the user types in the appropriate cost amount to purchase the particular drink. In order to determine the types of drinks available and its costs, the data was stored in a binary file.

# Assignment 2

In this project, I created a trivia game. In a txt file, I stored the questions along the right answer. This program can be played by two players. It will print out a questions for each player. From there it will compare the response that each player said to determine whether or not the response was right or wrong. It will increment or decrement the points accordingly. Finally, this program will determine the winner or loser.

# Assignment 3

In this project, there two text files that it will be looking at. The first file contains the contents of the Phonebook. The second file contains the contents of the Phone Entry.  The user is able to add name's and number's to the PhoneBook. They are also able to remove a person by name, number, or by name and number. These changes will be made accordingly to the two text files.

# Assignment 4

In this project, I created a phonebook. The user will be able to insert a contact information in their phonebook. It will be able to find the information of a particular person in the phonebook. It can also update the information. It also has a feature to delete a person from the phone book. Finally, it will be able to print out the contents to the user.
